This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

```{r read-data, include=FALSE}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")
```

```{r gdp-lifeExp-1997-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, fig.align="center"}
# make plot of gdp (x-axis) vs lifeExp (y-axis)
ggplot(gapminder_1997)+
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```


```{r basic-country-stats, echo=FALSE}
nCountries <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  select(country) %>%
  n_distinct()

# minimum GDP
minGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarize(round(min(gdpPercap))) %>%
  pull()

maxGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarize(round(max(gdpPercap))) %>%
  pull()
```

The number of countries in the dataset is `r nCountries`.
The minimum GDP is `r minGDP`.
The maximum GDP is `r maxGDP`.
