This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

```{r read-data}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")
```

```{r gdp-lifeExp-1997-plot}
# make plot of gdp (x-axis) vs lifeExp (y-axis)
ggplot(gapminder_1997)+
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
